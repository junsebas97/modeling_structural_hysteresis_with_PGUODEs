********** NOTES ***********

- Data was given by Profesor Daniel Beodya. According to the given file, it correspond to a postensioned wall.
- The initial condition corresponds to repose.
- According to the Profesor Daniel Bedoya, the mass could be assumed 600 kg.
- The yielding displacement is the second displacement because it was the largest displacement where the force-displacement curve can recover a (practically) zero displacement when unloading.
- The initial elastic stiffness is slope of the line between the origin and the second point of the force-displacement curve.
- The times are unknown.

Units:
Displacement  ---> [mm]
Force         ---> [kN]
Stiffness     ---> [kN/mm]
Mass          ---> [kg]
