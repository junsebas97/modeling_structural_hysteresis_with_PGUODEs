********** NOTES ***********

Data was taken from https://www.github.com/diegoandresalvarez/BWBN_TMCMC/blob/main/data/ . It must be complemented with additional information about time, units, initial conditions, and system parameters found in files https://www.github.com/diegoandresalvarez/BWBN_TMCMC/blob/main/BW_exp_data.m (lines 43, 45,
52) and https://www.github.com/diegoandresalvarez/BWBN_TMCMC/blob/main/log_p_X_theta.m (line 34).

The yielding displacement corresponds to the maximum displacement of the initial linear branch, x[6].

Units:
Displacement  ---> [mm]
Force         ---> [kN]
Stiffness     ---> [kN/mm]
Mass          ---> [kg]
